	<p> The Great and Powerful Yennifer of Oz was born in Kansas. She floated from a hot air balloon into the hot lands of Louisiana and realized she wasn't in Kansas any more. </p>

	<p>She was called upon by the mystical Gods and Goddesses to fullfill 12 Tasks in order to return to her homeland. She trudged through the vast and unfriendly swamps and slayed the Many-Headed Alligator. She hid in ambush for three days and three nights in order to steal the Red Neck's Cowboy Belt. She hitchhiked on the back of a pick-up truck and fasted for 40 nights and found a golden apple for each country song.</p>

	<p>She finally fullfilled her 12 Tasks and the Gods saw her fit to leave the hot lands of the south. They bid her close her eyes and spin in a circle three times counterclockwise and do the rain dance. She opened her eyes and she was suddenly in the magical Kingdom of Tufts.</p>

	<p>At the new kingdom she rode elephants and learned a lot about computers. Every weekend she continues to go on adventures - slaying dragons and feasting in Chinatown. And then she hired a fourth grader to design her biography and that is why everything is in Comic Sans and so beautifully colored.</p>
