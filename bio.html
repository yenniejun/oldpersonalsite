	<p> Yennie was born in Seoul, Korea. 
	She was raised in Massachusetts and grew up
	toddling around Tufts campus, where both of her parents attended graduate school.</p>

	<p>The year she turned 10, Yennie, her younger sister, and their two Physics PhD parents packed up their bags and moved south to Louisiana, where a job was offered to her father. She struggled through prison *cough* middle school and emerged valialntly from high school as the first in her class.</p>

	<p>Somehow she ended up back at Tufts for college. She came wanting to study international relations and changed her major every ten seconds or so. Finally she settled on Computer Science and learned that she liked coding and manipulating bits and making webpages and stuff like that.</p>

	<p>In her spare time, Yennie can be found playing piano or flute in the music building, biking around lakes, running to Chinatown, thrift shopping for new books, or in Halligan.</p>
