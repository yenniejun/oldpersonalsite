README for Comp 20 Assignment #1

I have created three files for this assignment.

index.html - my home page. Here I have a very simple layout with blocks. I have a photo of myself and links to my resume and bio. Although it is very sparse right now, I plan to add more links and information as my knowledge grows. 

resume.html - my resume. I borrowed the font from Google Fonts. I list my education, programming skills, jobs, experience, etc.

bio.html - my very sparse bio. Again, I used fonts from Google Fonts. 

All three of these html files are paired with a css stylesheet. In the stylesheets I color the fonts, center the texts and blocks and images, and design my webpage in a sort-of aesthetically pleasing way. (not that aesthetically pleasing but I'm working on it)

I correctly implemented the above. Some of the formatting is not as precise as I would like (such as the block formatting or image resizing). However, I managed to make a simplistic personal website. 

I did not collaborate with anyone. I spent 15-20 hours on this assignment (I spent more time than I would like to admit looking up fonts and colors)
